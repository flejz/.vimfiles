vim setup
========

# install
 ``` bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flejz/.vimfiles/master/setup.sh | bash
```

# optional steps ahead:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/powerline/fonts
sh ./fonts/install.sh
rm -rf fonts
```
After that, you can set the terminal font to a powerline font to be able to see 16-bit chars.
